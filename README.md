### Config
Before you start your application make sure you have created the file **.env** with the correct Docker configuration values.

    $ cp .env.example .env

### Run
To start you application you just need to run the following command 

    $ docker-compose up -d --build
    
### Test
##### PHP-FPM
Give it 5min while composer installs all the Lumen dependencies automatically under the vendor folder.

Once it has finished you should be able to see Lumen's default page on your [browser](http://127.0.0.1).

##### PHP-CLI
In order to run PHP on the command line you can list all the containers by running 

    $ docker-compose ps
    
Assuming you left the the config value `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=app` you should see a container running with the name **app_workspace_1**


All you have to do is to run the following command to use the workspace container as your main bash 

    $ docker exec -i -t app_workspace_1 /bin/bash

And then you will have PHP ready for you, just give it a try!


    $ php artisan
